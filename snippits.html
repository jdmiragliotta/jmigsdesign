          <h4>The Past <small><em>Where I Was Developed My Present</em></small></h4>
          <p id="past" class="long"> Growing up I always felt as though I have two brains. One had overall love for all things visually stimulating or appealing. And yes, I mean ALL things! The other, an undying yearning to understand how and why things works, so much so I destroyed a majority of my toys just to see the how they functioned. My background in Graphic Design satiated my creative desires, however my engineering brain was somewhat deprived. It clearly had the munchies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col l4 s12">
          <h4>The Present <small><em>Where I Am Will Inspire My Future</em></small></h4>
          <p class="long"> While my creative brain drives my desire to be a Front End Web Developer and make apps that look pretty, my persistent engineering brain wants to connection the visual with the workings underneath. The solution: Become a Full Stack Web Developer with a focus on Front End Development, specifically User Experience and Interaction. Design &amp; Development equals the perfect balance. Aestetically amazing and undoubtledly functional, just like yours truly.</p>

        <div class="col l4 s12">
          <h4>The Future <small><em>Where I'm Going Is In My Control</em></small></h4>
          <p class="long"> I'm definitely a Jack of All Trades - great a many skills, not an expert at anything in particular. I never want to become an expert in anything; it merely means that I've given up learning. What's the point in that? I always strive to learn a new skill and I've been taught to set and conquer my goals, then to contuinuously set new ones. It shows determination, hardwork and dedication to your craft. Basically, the future me will continue to be awesome.</p>
